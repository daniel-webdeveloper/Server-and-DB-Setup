This is a basic setup for a Website. Its backend is based on node.js and MongoDB (Mongoose).


To replicate what I did, just go to the folder where you're gonna build your project on, type "npm init -y" (using the terminal. Personally, I use vscode, so you can use its terminal or use your OS terminal);
Then, you'll have to type "npm i express ejs express-ejs-layouts";
Then, "npm i --save-dev nodemon";
You can already test your server by typing "npm run devStart" into the terminal (you have to be on the project folder for that).
Into your terminal, type "npm i mongoose" (Again, you need to have MongoDB installed. https://www.mongodb.com).
Now, type "npm i --save-dev dotenv" into the terminal;
As I've commented on the code, in order to run the server alongside with Mongoose, MongoDB needs to be installed and running. I'm on Ubuntu, so this is the link for Ubuntu users https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/#start-mongodb. You can just look for your OS of choice.

Good luck on your Web Dev career. :)
